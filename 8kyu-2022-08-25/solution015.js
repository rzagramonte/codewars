 Description:
Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?
P. - parameters: none
R. - return: returns the string of 'hello, world!'
E. - examples/edge cases: 'hello, world!'
P. - pseudocode: create a function declaration or assign an anon function value to a variable called greet
use arrow function
use the return keyword and the string 'hello, world!'
