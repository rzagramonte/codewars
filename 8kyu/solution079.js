parameters: two numbers
return: one number
examples:
input => output
(36,7) => 22
(55,30) => 5
(42,21) => 0
(22,1) => 20
(29,0) => 29
pseudocode:
declare function
set parameters
create if else statement
if dadYearsOld is greater than sonYears times two then return dadYears - (sonYearsOld times two)
else return (sonYearsOld times two) - dadYearsOld

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
    // your code here
    if (dadYearsOld > (sonYearsOld * 2)){
        return dadYearsOld - (sonYearsOld * 2);
      }else{
        return (sonYearsOld * 2) - dadYearsOld;
      };
